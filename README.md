# TensorFlow-Bootcamp
Hands-on deep learning projects using TensorFlow 2.x, covering CNNs, NLP, transfer learning, and more.

This repository contains my completed coursework and personal projects from the [TensorFlow Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/) by Daniel Bourke, hosted on Zero to Mastery.

## üß† About the Bootcamp

This intensive course is designed to prepare students for the official TensorFlow Developer Certificate. It covers:
- Deep learning fundamentals
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- TensorFlow best practices
- GPUs and TPUs
- Data analysis and preprocessing

## üìö What I Learned

Through hands-on notebooks and mini-projects, I built foundational and advanced skills in:
- TensorFlow 2.x and Keras
- Neural network design & training
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning
- Text classification with NLP
- TensorBoard, Model Checkpoints, EarlyStopping
- Model evaluation and deployment
